# Dijkstra
Dijkstra's algorithm with visualization your graph and decision for it.

When you start the program, you are asked to enter all the necessary data about your graph:
for each vertex the number of adjacent vertices and the distance to them.
Also you need to enter the start and end vertices.

Example:

Enter number of vertices:
5
Enter graph's adjacency list:
Enter count of neighbours of the vertex 0:
2
Enter 2 neighbours of the vertex 0 as pairs of two numbers to and len:
1 2
3 4
Enter count of neighbours of the vertex 1:
2
Enter 2 neighbours of the vertex 1 as pairs of two numbers to and len:
2	2
3	1
Enter count of neighbours of the vertex 2:
0
Enter 0 neighbours of the vertex 2 as pairs of two numbers to and len:
Enter count of neighbours of the vertex 3:
2
Enter 2 neighbours of the vertex 3 as pairs of two numbers to and len:
2 5
0 2
Enter count of neighbours of the vertex 4:
1
Enter 1 neighbours of the vertex 4 as pairs of two numbers to and len:
0	4
Enter starting vertex:
3
Enter ending vertex:
1
Your path: 3 0 1

After that you will see the picture with visualization your graph and the better way on it (for example above it's 3-0-1).

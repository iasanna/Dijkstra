# Dijkstra
Dijkstra's algorithm with visualization your graph and decision for it.

When you start the program, you are asked to enter all the necessary data about your graph:
for each vertex the number of adjacent vertices and the distance to them.
Also you need to enter the start and end vertices.

Example:

After that you will see the picture with visualization your graph and the better way on it (for example above it's 3-0-1).
